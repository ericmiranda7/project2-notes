# CPU Reset Vector
The location which the processor looks to first execute after powering on.

# Memory Distinctions
## Primary (Main) Memory
Two types
	1. (D)ynamic (R)andom (A)ccess (M)emory
		-> (S)ynchronousDRAM, etc. Cheap but slow because it requires to be refreshed. It is made up of 1 transistor (acts as a switch) and 1 capacitor (holds the charge)
	2. (S)tatic RAM
		-> Within CPU. Expensive but fast. Made of flipflops consisting entirely of transistors.

## Secondary Memory
AKA Flash Memory. It is non-volatile electrically programmable memory, hence flash.
Mainly
	- NOR Flash
		-> Expensive
	- NAND Flash
		-> Super common now
